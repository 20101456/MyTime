# MyTime
Software Engineering Practice

Product Vision
Our product is aimed for college students and lecturers who are looking for a solution to manage their class schedules.
MyTime is a timetabling and scheduling application that helps students and lecturers in SETU to plan their academic and personal lives. It shows them their class time, subject, and room number for each course, as well as the availability of other facilities such as computer labs, libraries, and study rooms.

Different from The SETU Website and Moodle, our product makes scheduling more accessible and personalised to everyone’s needs.

Features

1.	Class Schedule Management: Allows students and lecturers to input and view their class schedules in a user-friendly format.

2.	Assignment Tracker: Helps users keep track of assignment due dates and progress.

3.	Study Session Planner: Enables users to plan and manage their study sessions effectively.

4.	Notifications and Reminders: Sends timely reminders for upcoming classes, assignments, and study sessions.

5.	Integration with Academic Calendar: Syncs with the academic calendar to automatically update for holidays, exam periods, etc.

6.	Personalized User Profiles: Allows for customization based on the user’s role (student or lecturer), courses, and preferences.

7.	Cross-Platform Accessibility: Ensures the app is accessible on various devices and platforms for convenience.

8.	Lecturer Office Hours: Allows lecturers to set and students to view office hours.

9.	College Resources: Provides a space for sharing course-related resources and materials.
We looked at resources already available at the college such as Moodle and the SETU website and found them unintuitive and not very accessible. We want to make it is easier to access these features for general use by the students. Our hope is that if students can easily access resources like the Maths Help Centre for example, they will get the help needed to excel in their studies.

Personas
What is a Persona?

A persona is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way. Personas are used to help guide decisions about a product, such as features, interactions, and visual design.
Personas are extremely useful in giving a human face to an otherwise abstract user base. They typically include demographic information, behaviours, needs, and pain points.

Scenarios
What is a Scenario?
A user scenario describes the processes a user goes through to complete a task using a product, system, or service.
User scenarios are typically used in product development and user-centred design to help understand and cater to the user’s needs. They provide insights into the user’s motivations, expectations, and goals, and can help guide the design and development process.
