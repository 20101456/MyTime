# MyTime
Software Engineering Practice

Product Vision
Our product is aimed for college students and lecturers who are looking for a solution to manage their class schedules.
MyTime is a timetabling and scheduling application that helps students and lecturers in SETU to plan their academic and personal lives. It shows them their class time, subject, and room number for each course, as well as the availability of other facilities such as computer labs, libraries, and study rooms.

Different from The SETU Website and Moodle, our product makes scheduling more accessible and personalised to everyoneâ€™s needs.
